To be website on CImage image processing
===============================

Hi there.

Nice of you to stop by.

I am preparing this as a website for documentation and articles on image processing for the web programmer. The intention is to supply documentation and articles for using CImage.

I'll release this website officially when the documentation is complete for CImage version v0.7.\*. Until then you can check out the work in progress through the [documentation](doc) and the [blog](blog).

Cheers & happy coding,  
/Mikael
