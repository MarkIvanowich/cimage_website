======================================

[FIGURE src=/image/example/kodim04.png?w=730&a=40,0,50,0&w=630 caption="This is how `img.php?source=kodim04.png&area=40,0,50,0&w=630` could look like."]

Here are a few quick steps to get going with CImage and to get a basic understanding of how it works.



Check out the test page {#testpage}
--------------------------------------

There is a test page with a set of examples. Try it out by pointing your browser to the test file `webroot/test/test.php`. It will show example images processed in various ways and you can review how they are created.



Process your first image {#first}
--------------------------------------

Try it yourself by opening up an image in your browser. Start with selecting an image with the mandatory `src` option.

[FIGURE src=/image/example/kodim04.png?w=100&h=100&cf caption="A square thumbnail." class="right"]

> `img.php?src=kodim04.png` 

The try to resize the image to a thumbnail by adding the following options that define a width, height and crops the image to fit into the imaginary box, defined by the width and height options. 

> `&width=100&height=100&crop-to-fit`

This is the basics. You start by selecting an image source and then apply options for resize and processing the image.



Test directory {#testdir}
--------------------------------------

The directory `webroot/test` contains a set of testcases that you can review to learn how to use CImage.



Compare images {#compare}
--------------------------------------

The directory `webroot/compare` contains a compare tool you can use to visually compare images. Use this tool and overlay the images to find out how the processing options affect the image.
