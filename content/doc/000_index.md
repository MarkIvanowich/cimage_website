Welcome
===================================

[FIGURE src="/image/example/kodim07.png?w=w2&a=30,1,35,12" caption="Image processing using PHP GD."]

This is the manual and documentation for CImage and img.php.

This is the most up to date version of the manual that currently exists.

Some features may be further documented in their related [issues](https://github.com/mosbth/cimage/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).

*Work is ongoing to fully document version v0.7.x, approximate more than 95% of the documentation is complete.*
