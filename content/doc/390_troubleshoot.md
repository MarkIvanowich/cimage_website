Troubleshoot image processing
================================

Here are a few useful tools to troubleshoot the image processing and to control how the cached image is created.



JSON representation of the image {#json}
----------------------------------

You can get a JSON representation of the image by adding the option `json`. This can be useful if you need to know the actual dimension of the image, or just for troubleshooting.

For example, take the image created like this:

> `&w=300&save-as=jpg`

<img src=/image/example/kodim24.png&w=300&save-as=jpg alt=''>

Its JSON-representation is retrieved like this:

> `&w=300&save-as=jpg&json`

Which gives the following result.

```javascript
{
    "src": "example/kodim24.png",
    "srcGmdate": "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 08:19:09",
    "cache": "example_kodim24.png_300_200_q60_co-1_jpg",
    "cacheGmdate": "Sun, 20 Nov 2016 15:48:06",
    "filename": "example_kodim24.png_300_200_q60_co-1_jpg",
    "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
    "width": 300,
    "height": 200,
    "aspectRatio": 1.5,
    "size": 10998,
    "colors": 25590,
    "includedFiles": 2,
    "memoryPeek": "4.306 MB",
    "memoryCurrent": "0.338 MB",
    "memoryLimit": "128M",
    "loadTime": "0.059s"
}
```

I'll use this feature for ease testing, but the feature can also be useful when one really want complete control over the resulting dimension of an image.



Verbose output {#verbose}
----------------------------------

You can visualize what happens during image processing by adding the `v, verbose` parameter. It will display the resulting image together with a verbose output on what is actually happening behind the scene.

[FIGURE src=/image/cimage-verbose-output.png?w=w2&q=60&sharpen caption="This is output from verbose output."]

This can be useful for debugging and to understand what actually happens during processing of the image.

This option is only available when running in development mode.



Ignore the cache {#no-cache}
----------------------------------

The parameter `nc, no-cache` ignores the cached item and will always create a new cached item.

This can be useful when having older items in the cache and one wants to ensure that the cached item is re-created.



Skip the original image {#skip-original}
----------------------------------

The parameter `so, skip-original` skips the original image, even if the original image is the best fit. As a result a cached image is created and displayed.

You can configure to always skip the original image. This is how the default configuration looks like.

```php
/**
 * Set skip-original to true to always process the image and use
 * the cached version. Default is false and to use the original
 * image when its no processing needed.
 *
 * Default value:
 *  skip_original: false
 */
 //'skip_original' => false,
```



Check your environment {#env}
----------------------------------

There are tools to [check your installed environment](check-environment).
